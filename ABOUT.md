# 🚀 The Ideas Vault: Your AI Startup Incubator

## The Elevator Pitch
"Ideas Vault" is a personal, secure digital notebook that doesn't just store your startup ideas—it **validates** them. It acts like having a 24/7 Venture Capitalist analyst in your pocket who instantly researches the market potential of your random shower thoughts.

## 1. How it Works (The User Journey)
1.  **Log In**: You sign in to your private vault (secured by Supabase).
2.  **Capture**: You have a sudden flash of inspiration. You click "New Idea" and type it out (e.g., "Uber for Dog Walking").
3.  **The "Magic" (AI Research)**:
    - Instead of just saving the text, the app sends your idea to an **AI Agent**.
    - The Agent (acting as a Senior VC Analyst) researches the concept in real-time.
4.  **The Result**: Seconds later, your dashboard updates with a structured **Research Report** attached to the idea, including:
    - **Readiness Score**: A 0-100 rating of how viable it is.
    - **Market Size**: Estimated TAM (e.g., "$1.2 Billion").
    - **Competitors**: Who else is doing this?
    - **Action Plan**: The first 3 steps you should take to build it.

## 2. Why We Made It
- **Problem**: Most great ideas die because we forget them, or we get discouraged because we don't know where to start. Market research is boring and time-consuming.
- **Solution**: We automated the boring part. By combining **Memory** (Database) with **Intelligence** (AI), we created a tool that turns "passive thoughts" into "actionable projects" instantly.

## 3. Key Features We Built
- **"Bring Your Own Key" AI**: You aren't locked into one AI provider. You can plug in your own OpenRouter/OpenAI/Grok keys to power the brain.
- **Secure Storage**: Uses Postgres (Supabase) so you own your data.
- **Multi-Modal Inputs**: Support for Voice Notes and Images (Architecture ready).
